🔗 Component Hierarchy & Data Flow
Homepage WeTransfer Flow:
app/page.tsx (Landing)
    ↓
<EmailWithProTips />                    # Layout wrapper with 6 pro-tip circles
    ↓ 
<DemoUpload />                          # ACTUAL WeTransfer functionality
    ↓
5-Step Process:
1. Email verification
2. "Check your email" waiting
3. File upload with drag & drop
4. Send form (name, recipient, message)
5. Success confirmation
Premium User Flow:
Header → Login Button
    ↓
app/login/page.tsx                      # Authentication
    ↓ (localStorage: admin@flowen.se / flowen123)
app/dashboard/page.tsx                  # Overview with stats
    ↓ "View All Projects"
app/projects/page.tsx                   # Project rooms with folders
    ↓
Features: Drag & drop, folder creation, user isolation

🔐 Security Implementation
End-to-End Encryption (AES-256-GCM):
1.	Client generates unique key per file
2.	Encrypt file before upload
3.	Server stores encrypted blob + metadata
4.	Download URL contains decryption key: ?key=base64key
5.	Client decrypts after download
User Isolation (Premium):
•	File naming: {userId}-{timestamp}-{random}
•	Auth middleware: Validates user before API access
•	Metadata tracking: Who uploaded what when
•	Folder separation: Users only see their content
Authentication (Current POC):
•	Method: localStorage (temporary)
•	Credentials: admin@flowen.se / flowen123
•	Middleware: Inline auth in API routes (fixed import issues)
•	Future: JWT tokens

🌐 Environment Architecture
Local Development:
Frontend: localhost:3000 (Next.js)
    ↓ API calls to
Backend: localhost:3001 (Express.js)
    ↓ Uses
Microsoft Graph API (Email)
File Storage: C:\flowen-backend\uploads\
Production:
Frontend + API: flowen.eu (Next.js All-in-One)
    ↓ No separate backend
Next.js API Routes handle everything
    ↓ Uses  
Microsoft Graph API (Email)
File Storage: Server filesystem

📋 Development Workflow
Git Structure:
main                           # Production branch
development                    # Integration branch  
feature/projektrum-rebuild     # Current active feature

# Daily workflow with auto-timestamps:
git checkout feature/projektrum-rebuild
git add .
git dcommit "Feature description"    # Adds timestamp automatically
git push origin feature/projektrum-rebuild
Local Testing:
# Frontend
cd C:\flowen-landing\flowen-site
npm run dev                    # localhost:3000

# Backend (if needed)
cd C:\flowen-backend
npm start                      # localhost:3001

# Test with REST Client:
# Use test-upload.http in VS Code
Production Deployment:
ssh root@ovh-server
cd /var/www/flowen
git pull origin main
npm run build
pm2 restart flowen

🔍 Key Technical Decisions
Why Two Upload Components?
•	DemoUpload.tsx: Full-featured WeTransfer (22593 bytes)
•	FlowenUploadFlow.tsx: Simplified 3-step alternative (3520 bytes)
•	EmailWithProTips: Layout wrapper with marketing pro-tips
Why Local Backend + Production API Routes?
•	Local: Express.js for flexibility and debugging
•	Production: Next.js API routes for simpler deployment
•	Same encryption logic works in both environments
Why Inline Auth Middleware?
•	Import issues: Next.js API routes couldn't resolve auth imports
•	Quick solution: Moved auth logic directly into upload route
•	Works perfectly: User isolation functional, will refactor later

🚨 Known Issues & Limitations
Authentication System:
•	localStorage: Not production-ready (temporary POC)
•	Session management: Basic, needs JWT implementation
•	Multi-user: Currently single test user
File Management:
•	Download UI: Not implemented in projects page yet
•	File preview: Shows icons only, no thumbnails
•	File deletion: Not implemented yet
API Testing:
•	Manual only: No automated test suite
•	Error handling: Could be more robust
•	Logging: Basic console logging only
________________________________________
🎯 Next Priority Development
Immediate (This Week):
1.	Test projects upload: Verify real file upload in projects page
2.	Implement file download: From projects page with decryption
3.	Add file deletion: Remove files and metadata
4.	Test navigation: Ensure all flows work smoothly
Short Term (This Month):
1.	Better authentication: JWT instead of localStorage
2.	File preview: Images, PDFs in projects
3.	Kanban boards: /kanban page for task management
4.	Social wall: /social page for team communication
Long Term (3 Months):
1.	CRM functionality: Customer management features
2.	Team collaboration: Multi-user project sharing
3.	Advanced analytics: Usage insights and reporting
4.	Mobile app: React Native implementation
